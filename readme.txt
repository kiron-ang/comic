Some counties in Texas are currently suffering from a measles outbreak (https://dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025). In response, the Texas Department of State Health Services has increasingly promoted its online vaccination data (https://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunizations/data/school/coverage). This data reveals that some schools in affected counties have low MMR vaccination rates among their seventh graders. Texans' refusal to vaccinate their children is reflective of vaccine hesitancy generated by politcally conservative views on healthcare (https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy7eyde3xeo). Please vaccinate your children, because "almost everyone without immunity will get measles if exposed to the virus" and "there is no specific treatment to cure measles" (https://dshs.texas.gov/measles/measles-frequently-asked-questions).
