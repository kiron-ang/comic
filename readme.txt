In response, the Texas Department of State Health Services promoted their online vaccination data; click on the sentences on this page to see some helpful websites (https://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunizations/data/school/coverage). This data reveals that some schools in affected counties have low seventh grade vaccination coverage for the MMR vaccine (https://github.com/kiron-ang/infographic).

Please vaccinate your children, because "almost everyone without immunity will get measles if exposed to the virus" and "there is no specific treatment to cure measles" (https://dshs.texas.gov/measles/measles-frequently-asked-questions).
