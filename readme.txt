We currently have a measles outbreak in our wonderful state of Texas (https://dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025). In response, the Texas Department of State Health Services has made vaccine-related data more accessible than ever before (https://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunizations/data/school/coverage). This data reveals that many children in Texas lack the MMR vaccine. Texans' refusal to vaccinate their children is reflective of vaccine hesitancy generated by politcally conservative views on healthcare (https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy7eyde3xeo). Please vaccinate your children, because "almost everyone without immunity will get measles if exposed to the virus" and "there is no specific treatment to cure measles" (https://dshs.texas.gov/measles/measles-frequently-asked-questions).
