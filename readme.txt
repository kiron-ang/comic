Some counties in Texas are currently suffering from a measles outbreak (https://dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025). In response, the Texas Department of State Health Services has increasingly promoted its online vaccination data; click on the sentences in this comic to open different websites about this topic (https://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunizations/data/school/coverage). This data reveals that some schools in affected counties have low seventh grade vaccination coverage levels for the MMR vaccine (https://github.com/kiron-ang/comic). Texans' refusal to vaccinate their children is reflective of vaccine hesitancy generated by politcally conservative views on healthcare (https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy7eyde3xeo). Please vaccinate your children, because "almost everyone without immunity will get measles if exposed to the virus" and "there is no specific treatment to cure measles" (https://dshs.texas.gov/measles/measles-frequently-asked-questions).
